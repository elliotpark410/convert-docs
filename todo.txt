To Do List
-get write access to garuda/jagad repo
-have docker container update with latest output.yaml


Debug list
-the docs don't update automatically in localhost, if I use the same port it will show the old doc. Need to kill old port 
-alwhen I run script "npm run convert" after the first time, I get this error "docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint dreamy_hermann (30cac2f8dcdaf73c6f81ae609997f97c518edce1cac934fdf37cbb9bce20e0f8): Bind for 0.0.0.0:4567 failed: port is already allocated."
-in Demo 3 June.postman, the preview does not show section 'Add MMI Pool'


Fixed list
-Error: In v1.collection.json when running node index.js: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'raw')". It has something to do with the User Profile / Create Profile POST method. -Fix: In Postman, Create Profile body is not in JSON format

-Error: In v1.collection.json when running node index.js: "Error: Error parsing response example "Transfer GIDR - Success". It has something to do with the User Wallet
-Fix: In Postman, remove extra comma at the end of body in Transfer GIDR - Success
