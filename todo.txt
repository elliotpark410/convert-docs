To Do List
-watch zoom video C:\Users\ellio\OneDrive\Desktop\Garuda Admin/Elliot-Elbert-bash-scripting
-Learn Bash Scripting: https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/
-Learn about pm2
-in jagad repo, look at server/start.sh and server/ecosystem.config.cjs and tsc-pm2.json. look for function with RESULT$(bash -c "docker ps -a" container id and container status
-make a standalone script a .sh file to run docker. bash script should do:
1. rebuild the docker (i may be wrong, but i think you can rebuild docker and use the same container. If cannot, that's okay, delete first and launch new container. You can see how to get container id in server/start.sh)
2. then, using pm2, we can watch the changes in folder to auto run your script everytime there's changes

-get write access to garuda/jagad repo
